<h1>modbusTCP: Modbus TCP/IP Support - Release Notes</h1>

<center>
<h2>Release 1-3</h2>
<h2>June xxx, 2008</h2>
</center>
<ul>
  <li>Changed modbusInterpose.c to replace pasynOctet->writeRaw() and 
      pasynOctet->readRaw() with pasynOctet->write() and pasynOctet->read(),
      because the raw routines have been removed in asyn R4-10.
</ul>

<h2>Release 1-2</h2>
<h2>September 6, 2007</h2>
</center>
<ul>
  <li> Fixed bug in computing byteCount in WRITE_MULTIPLE_COILS function code.
</ul>
There is a known limitation with using serial interfaces.  
It is not currently possible to have multiple Modbus servers connected to a single serial port.
This is a limitation of the asynInterposeInterface architecture used.
It may be fixed in a future release.
